# PlayerpointPrediction

## Description

Goal of this project is to predict (using machine learning (ML)) the points from a Bundesliga player for the kicker Managerspiel.
As data only the player, their position, club, grade 2016, points 2016 and points 2017 exists until now. (so no regression over severeal seasons is possible)
 
## Next Steps
Player data from whoscored.com can be merged in to increase the features. Also whoscored grade can be used for regression over several seasons and ML could be used to connect whoscored grades and kicker manager points.
